Intro to HoloViews and Advanced Interactive Visualizations

I used Python 3.7 to develop this, but Python 3.5 or higher should work. 
Required libraries are Jupyter, Bokeh, Matplotlib, Pandas, and HoloViews. 

* [Instructions for installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install.html).
* The [HoloViews installation instructions](http://holoviews.org/install.html) can help you get the rest.
* alternatively you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` from within a virtualenv to replicate what I had

You can then download a ZIP archive of this code from the link on GitHub to follow along or refer to later.
